      <h2>Introduction to Web Exploitation</h2>
      <p>
        Web exploitation is the act of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications.
        Nearly every website or app on your PC or smartphone is a web application, or at least interacts with one via an API.
        Because almost every company deploys web apps (not just tech companies like Google, but also newspaper publishers and coffee companies).
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding web vulnerabilities is crucial for ethical hacking, bug bounty programs, and improving web application security.
        By learning how these exploits work, you can better protect your applications from real-world attacks.

              A white hat (or a white-hat hacker, a whitehat) is an ethical security hacker.
              Ethical hacking is a term meant to imply a broader category than just penetration testing.
              Under the owner's consent, white-hat hackers aim to identify any vulnerabilities or security issues the current system has.

          <p>
            In ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, the goal is to test the security of systems, networks, or applications to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious hackers (black-hat hackers).
            Ethical hackers are authorized to attempt hacking into systems with the purpose of improving their security.

          <h2>Common Web Vulnerabilities</h2>
          
          <article id="sql">
            <h3>SQL Injection (SQLi)</h3>
                <p>SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g., to dump the database contents to the attacker).</p>
                <p>It occurs when a web application asks a user for input (e.g., username/password), and the input is improperly filtered or sanitized before being passed into a SQL query. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query and gain unauthorized access to the database or even delete or modify data.</p>
                <p>SQL statements can look like this:</p>
                <pre><code>
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = 'password';
                </code></pre>
                <p>But, in an SQL injection attack, an attacker can manipulate the query by inputting something like this:</p>
                <pre><code>
' OR '1'='1'; --
                </code></pre>
                <p>This can result in a query that always evaluates to true, granting the attacker unauthorized access to the application. For example, the modified query might look like this:</p>
                <pre><code>
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' --' AND password = '';
                </code></pre>
                <p>In this case, the attacker could bypass the authentication mechanism and log in as an administrator or any user without knowing their password.</p>
                <p>To prevent SQL injection, it is crucial to:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Use prepared statements and parameterized queries.</li>
                <li>Ensure that all user input is validated and sanitized before being passed into SQL queries.</li>
                <li>Limit database permissions for users and applications.</li>
                <li>Enable error handling to avoid exposing sensitive database errors to end-users.</li>
                </ul>
          </article>

          <article id="xss">
            <h3>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>
            <p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript codes into web pages viewed by other users. The malicious script is executed in the context of the victim’s browser, allowing attackers to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, as well as perform actions on behalf of the victim.</p>
            <p>XSS attacks can be categorized into three main types:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Stored XSS:</strong> The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server, such as in a database, and is served to users who visit the affected page.</li>
              <li><strong>Reflected XSS:</strong> The malicious script is reflected off a web server, such as through a URL or a search query. The script is executed immediately when the victim clicks a link or visits a URL with the malicious payload.</li>
              <li><strong>DOM-based XSS:</strong> The vulnerability is in the client-side code, typically JavaScript, and is triggered when the victim interacts with the page. The page itself doesn't interact with the server in this case.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here’s an example of a simple XSS payload that could trigger an alert box in the victim’s browser:</p>
            <strong>Example Payload:</strong>
            <pre><code>
&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS Vulnerablity Found')&lt;/script&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>When injected into a vulnerable input field, this code would display an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerablity Found" when a victim views the page.</p>
            <strong>Another example Payload showcasing stored cookie on victim's browser:</strong>
            <pre><code>
&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;
            </code></pre>
          
            <p>XSS attacks can be used to steal sensitive information such as cookies and session data, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions in the victim's browser.</p>
          
            <p>To prevent XSS attacks, it is important to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sanitize and escape user input, especially when inserting it into HTML, JavaScript, or other client-side contexts.</li>
              <li>Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.</li>
              <li>Ensure that HTML elements such as script tags and event attributes are not used with unsanitized user data.</li>
              <li>Implement proper HTTP response headers like X-XSS-Protection to mitigate XSS attacks in some browsers.</li>
            </ul>
          </article>
          
          <article id="csrf">
            <h3>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h3>
            <p>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that tricks an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions on a website without their consent. CSRF exploits the trust that a website has in a user's browser. When a user is logged into a web application (e.g., a banking website) and visits a malicious page, the attack could cause the user to perform actions such as transferring funds or changing their email address.</p>
            
            <p>The attacker sends a request to a vulnerable web application on behalf of the victim. Since the victim is already authenticated (i.e., they have an active session), their browser automatically includes the session cookies with the request, allowing the malicious action to be performed as though the victim themselves initiated it. This is why CSRF attacks are particularly dangerous when the victim has a high level of access, such as administrative privileges.</p>
            
            <p>Here’s an example of a CSRF attack using an image tag to trigger an action like deleting an account:</p>
            <strong>Example Payload:</strong>
            <pre><code>
&lt;img src="http://example.com/delete-account" /&gt;
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>In this example, an attacker can trick a victim into clicking an image tag or visiting a malicious page that sends an unauthorized request to the web application (e.g., to delete the user's account). Since the victim is already logged into the target site, the session cookie is sent along with the request, which the web application processes as though it was made by the victim.</p>
          
            <p>CSRF attacks typically occur when the website does not have sufficient protections, such as verifying the authenticity of the request or validating that the request was made intentionally by the user.</p>
          
            <p>To prevent CSRF attacks, websites can implement the following strategies:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>CSRF Tokens:</strong> Websites should use unique tokens in forms or requests to verify that the request is coming from an authenticated user and that it originated from the intended site. These tokens are generated for each session and checked on submission.</li>
              <li><strong>SameSite Cookies:</strong> The SameSite cookie attribute prevents cookies from being sent along with cross-site requests. By setting the cookie to "SameSite=Strict" or "SameSite=Lax", it ensures that cookies are not sent along with cross-origin requests. (when a web page makes a request to a different domain than its own.)</li>
              <li><strong>Referer Header Validation:</strong> Websites can check the "Referer" HTTP header to ensure the request is coming from an expected origin and not from a third-party site.</li>
              <li><strong>Double Submit Cookies:</strong> In this technique, a CSRF token is stored in both a cookie and a request parameter, and both values are checked for consistency on the server side.</li>
            </ul>

          <article id="idor">
            <h3>Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)</h3>
            <p>IDOR vulnerabilities allow attackers to access unauthorized resources by manipulating input parameters.</p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
            <pre><code>
http://example.com/profile?id=123
// Change ?id=123 to ?id=124

            <h3>Remote Code Execution (RCE)</h3>
            <p>RCE allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a server.</p>
            <strong>Example Payload:</strong>
            <pre><code>
http://example.com/run.php?cmd=ls
            </code></pre>

          <article id="command-injection">
            <h3>Command Injection</h3>
            <p>Command Injection occurs when input is passed to a system command, allowing attackers to execute commands.</p>
            <strong>Example Payload:</strong>
            <pre><code>
& echo "Hacked" &
